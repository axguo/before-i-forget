  "I think I have five big frogs right now.",
  "The internet has weather too.",

  "I feel an excitement so forceful it knocks me out of focus (this happens too often, be still my heart)",

  "I’m feeling so lucky and full of love, I am filled to the brim and overflowing.",
  "How would I act if I really cared about the things I said I did!",
  "To say I am present here with you is to say I love you.",
  "I LOVE a good unreliable narrator // I’m starting to feel a bit unreliable myself.",
  "Is this thought causing me to suffer? could i stop listening to it... and not suffer?",
  "I want to become intimate with a color.",
  "I'm getting into romcoms again. Maybe this is what they mean by nature is healing. To wish to be a girl in a string of coincidences that lead to the perfect guy.",
  "Speaking is a position of power. I admire people who naturally take up space and make space for others.",
  "Thinking about the ways dependence can lead to independence, how we can fearlessly fail when we have a support system to come back to.",
  "How much my life would improve if I didn't get so car sick. What other bits of my life would have this much impact?",

  "There are a few things I do daily now. I paint a small square of the sky each day. I read a poem each day. I feel impure when I put them on the todo list, after all, rituals shouldn't need checkboxes, no?",
  "In this discomfort I realize that I have a sense of home, small as it is. When the grayness-but-really-white-lack-of-shadows gets to me I wishi to be in my room, where the warm glow of half a dozen bulbs and my craft table feel like a hug.",
  "N did my tarot reading while I cooked and said I had no cup cards. I’m not driven by emotion right now. I should take a break or risk burnout, there is an abundance of creativity right now, I shouldn't stay in a job I dislike, and there will soon be a work/relationship situation where I'll have to stand my ground with my values.",

  "And I keep writing and writing and writing for a whole three minutes maybe? Is that three pages? If I do this continuously, will my creative energy be unblocked?",
  "Funny how with any journaling, I always come out with actionables. Things I can do and if nothing else that is a reason to keep writing. I have so many loves that have been subdued.",
  "How do you know if you love somebody?",
  "I want to write poems instead of just reading, I want to do research instead of just consuming. I want to create art instead of just being jealous.",
  "I feel super overwhelmed and worried that I won't be able to be present when I'm with G because I'll be thinking so much about work.",

  "It feels weird not to be surrounded by people anymore. I will definitely miss that.",

  "What would be the fun thing?? Writing a substack? Also a lot of things to submit!!",
  "Summer in boston is magical. I've never seen things SO GREEN and the water so sparkly and I wouldn't be surprised if there were fairies all around us. I've been a bit in my own head this past week and forgotten to notice how the city was glowing around me. I forgot to breathe.",
  "Today I am not yet quite at love.",
  "I feel really seen when I’m around E.",

  "There's something about walking through a city crying at night. therapeutic? Revealing?",
  "In the dark, it is safe to feel everything where only the moon and the glowing dandelions can see you.",

  "The second tarot reading I had stressed the importance of story - the story I tell myself and about myself as I navigate a new community and choose what to keep and what to leave behind from my previous context.

  "I was so scared of not being able to keep up a practice that I over committed myself in the name of accountability.",
