    "While the cheesecakes were baking N convinced me to start a new book and I did a warm eye compress. At some point when I was cleaning up my roommate walked in and asked if I was okay, it seemed like I had been in the kitchen for six hours. just a casual thursday night.",
    "Summer in boston is magical. I've never seen things SO GREEN and the water so sparkly and I wouldn't be surprised if there were fairies all around us. I've been a bit in my own head this past week and forgotten to notice how the city was glowing around me. I forgot to breathe.",
    "We skipped a whole summer here. I walked back the way from work --- about an hour but more because I think I took a longer way. I decided to walk because I don’t like the way the trains feel except for when they’re completely empty but G called and I felt so bothered that I decided to walk it off and ended up crying it out too.",
    "N did my tarot reading while I cooked and said I had no cup cards:I’m not driven by emotion right now. I should take a break or risk burnout, there is an abundance of creativity right now, I shouldn't stay in a job I dislike, and there will soon be a work/relationship situation where I'll have to stand my ground with my values."
